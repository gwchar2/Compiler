num/0 -> 0 or 0.0 deppending on num type

for every immediate value in the program, there is a temporary assigned to it. But the assign does not show in the commands. (I noted it so that the program wont get to long)

if a float is casted to float, or an int to int, nothing happens.

all vars marked t[0-9]* are saved for temporaries.

temporary variables stay as they are assigned, int or float, and do not change throughout the program.

quad code is not really optimized, but at least it has clarity, so it is easily tracable.
